# aws-highly-available-scalable-webapp
This repository contains the project files for building a highly available, scalable web application on AWS. This project is part of the AWS Academy Lab Project, where we implement real-world use cases using various AWS services to demonstrate best practices for scalability, availability, and cost optimization.

Project Overview
This project involves multiple phases:

Creating a basic functional web application on a single EC2 instance.
Decoupling the application by separating the web server and database.
Implementing high availability and scalability by leveraging Auto Scaling and Load Balancing.
As part of the AWS Academy Lab, this project adheres to the following goals:

Cloud-native architecture using AWS best practices.
Hands-on learning with AWS services like EC2, RDS, Auto Scaling, Load Balancer, VPC, and Secrets Manager.
Cost optimization within a budget of $100/month.

Phases of Implementation
Phase 1: Planning and Design
In this phase, we planned the architecture and estimated the cost of the AWS services required for the project. The core AWS services involved include:

Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic.
Amazon EC2: Web servers for hosting the application.
Amazon RDS: Managed relational database to store student records.
Amazon VPC: Virtual network for secure hosting.
Security Groups and NACLs: To ensure secure access to resources.
Amazon S3 or EFS (Optional): For storing static assets or backups.
Phase 2: Creating a Basic Functional Web Application
Task 1: Creating a Virtual Network
Set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with subnets for hosting the web application.

Task 2: Creating a Virtual Machine
Launch an EC2 instance using the latest Ubuntu AMI to host the web application. Install necessary packages using the JavaScript code from the following link:

SolutionCodePOC

Task 3: Testing the Deployment
Access the web application using the IPv4 address of the EC2 instance and test CRUD operations such as viewing, adding, deleting, or modifying records.

Phase 3: Decoupling the Application Components
Task 1: Updating the VPC Configuration
Modify the VPC to include private subnets in at least two Availability Zones.

Task 2: Creating and Configuring Amazon RDS
Provision an Amazon RDS instance with MySQL. Configure the database to be accessed only by the web application.

Task 3: Configuring the Development Environment
Provision an AWS Cloud9 environment and connect using SSH.

Task 4: Using AWS Secrets Manager
Create a secret for database credentials using AWS Secrets Manager. Use the provided script to configure Secrets Manager:

AWS Cloud9 Scripts

Task 5: Provisioning a New Web Server Instance
Launch another EC2 instance for the web application and configure it to connect to Amazon RDS.

Task 6: Migrating the Database
Use a provided script to migrate data from the original EC2-hosted database to the Amazon RDS instance.

Task 7: Testing the Application
Test the application again by performing CRUD operations.

Phase 4: Implementing High Availability and Scalability
Task 1: Creating an Application Load Balancer
Set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances.

Task 2: Implementing EC2 Auto Scaling
Configure EC2 Auto Scaling using a launch template. Ensure that the Auto Scaling group adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on traffic.

Task 3: Accessing the Application
Access the web application using the Load Balancer's endpoint and test its functionality.

Task 4: Load Testing
Perform load testing using a provided script to validate the scalability of the web application:
